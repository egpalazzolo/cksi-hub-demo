The story begins with Dr. Perry D. Robinson, Sr., M.D. (1862—1940), a respectable African American medical physician in the late 1800s to early and mid-1900s.  He was a member of the National Medical Association.  He was born in Pennsylvania and graduated medical school from Howard University.  Dr. Robinson had a medical practice in Lexington, KY with his professional colleague Dr. John E. Hunter, M.D., who was from Virginia and was the first African American surgeon at the St. Joseph’s Hospital, Lexington, KY.  Both Dr. Robinson and Dr. Hunter were respected by their White colleagues and peers of the medical profession, in one article they were noted for “good citizenship…learned skillful and well-known physicians and surgeons”.  Religiously, Dr. Robinson was a member of the historic St. Paul’s A.M.E. Church in Lexington, KY.  In April of 1899, the well-known poet, Paul Laurence Dunbar was in Lexington, KY and Dr. Robinson and his wife were entertained him as guest and hosted him during his stay in Lexington.<br>       
<br>   
On February 7, 1925, Dr. Robinson and a friend Emmet H. Reed (Reid) purchased property (*see Fayette County Clerk Deed 229 Page 145*).  Emmet Reed worked in various fields of occupations, from domestic service, transportation, funeral service, and farm labor.  The property which Dr. Robinson and Mr. Reed purchased together was approximately 13 acres located about 1 mile near the city limits along the waters of Cane Run in proximity to the historic African American Community known as Warrentown.  Deeds and property history refer to this property being off Maysville Pike (Maysville Turnpike, Maysville Rd., Paris Turnpike, Paris Rd., Mulberry St., Limestone St., or the road leading to Limestone, KY which is now known as Maysville, KY).<br>   
<br>   
Dr. Robinson and Reed subdivided the area into a subdivision plat in February 1925 called Caroline Park which said plat was recorded in the Fayette County Clerk’s Office on March 3, 1925 (*see Plat Cabinet E Slide 318* *or* *Plat Book 2 Page 142*).  During this time, most of the White subdivided communities filed deed restrictive racial covenant agreements which restricted the Black community from purchasing, owning, and occupying property in White neighborhoods; however, some racial restrictions did allow Black people to live in the house with their White property owners as servants. Within this landscape, Dr. Robinson and Reed’s intent was to establish a marketable community for Black residents to live in the quality and manner of the White community.<br>
