The story begins with Dr. Perry D. Robinson, Sr., M.D. (1862—1940), a respectable African American medical physician in the late 1800s to early and mid-1900s.  He was a member of the National Medical Association.  He was born in Pennsylvania and graduated medical school from Howard University.  Dr. Robinson had a medical practice in Lexington, KY with his professional colleague Dr. John E. Hunter, M.D., who was from Virginia and was the first African American surgeon at the St. Joseph’s Hospital, Lexington, KY.  Both Dr. Robinson and Dr. Hunter were respected by their White colleagues and peers of the medical profession, in one article they were noted for “good citizenship…learned skillful and well-known physicians and surgeons”.  Religiously, Dr. Robinson was a member of the historic St. Paul’s A.M.E. Church in Lexington, KY.  In April of 1899, the well-known poet, Paul Laurence Dunbar was in Lexington, KY and Dr. Robinson and his wife were entertained him as guest and hosted him during his stay in Lexington.<br>       
<br>   
On February 7, 1925, Dr. Robinson and a friend Emmet H. Reed (Reid) purchased property (*see (Fayette County Clerk Deed 229 Page 145)[link to deed site]*).  Emmet Reed worked in various fields of occupations, from domestic service, transportation, funeral service, and farm labor.  The property which Dr. Robinson and Mr. Reed purchased together was approximately 13 acres located about 1 mile near the city limits along the waters of Cane Run in proximity to the historic African American Community known as Warrentown.  Deeds and property history refer to this property being off Maysville Pike (Maysville Turnpike, Maysville Rd., Paris Turnpike, Paris Rd., Mulberry St., Limestone St., or the road leading to Limestone, KY which is now known as Maysville, KY).<br>   
<br>   
Dr. Robinson and Reed subdivided the area into a subdivision plat in February 1925 called Caroline Park which said plat was recorded in the Fayette County Clerk’s Office on March 3, 1925 (*see [Plat Cabinet E Slide 318](link to slide)* *or* *[Plat Book 2 Page 142](link to book)*).  During this time, most of the White subdivided communities filed deed restrictive racial covenant agreements which restricted the Black community from purchasing, owning, and occupying property in White neighborhoods; however, some racial restrictions did allow Black people to live in the house with their White property owners as servants. Within this landscape, Dr. Robinson and Reed’s intent was to establish a marketable community for Black residents to live in the quality and manner of the White community.<br>   
<br> 
Unfortunately, the old cliché, ‘what is good for the goose is good for the gander’ did not apply in the case of Caroline Park.  Neighboring White communities did everything in their position, power, and privilege to protest, intimidate, threaten, and eventually stop the development of Caroline Park.  The white community expressed interest in purchasing the property from Dr. Robinson and Mr. Reed—though not at market value—in order to incorporate the land into their own developments or establish a new White subdivision. However, neither Robinson nor Reed had any intention sell. This refusal was seen by many in the White community as offensive and stubborn, as they believed that a Black-owned neighborhood would lower the value of their own properties. <br>   
<br> 
Later multiple malpractice complaints were filed against Dr. Robinson.  Emmett Reed's legal troubles were used to further discredit the two business partners, reinforcing the perception that they lacked good character, and thus so would their proposed subdivision.<br>   
<br> 
Early on as the White community were tearing down the life of Dr. Robinson with active threats, he did what he thought was best; stand up, speak out, and sell his interest in the property to his friend, Emmett Reed on January 1, 1926 (*see Fayette County Clerk Deed Book 235 Page 584*).  And, later as the White community were tearing down the life of Mr. Reed through legal suits filed, he did what he thought was best which was to sell the entire property to F. G. Stilz (Fred) on February 3, 1926 (*see Fayette County Clerk Deed Book 235 Page 586*).  Then, on September 21, 1938, Fred Stilz eventually sold the property to Savage Lumber & Manufacturing Company (*see Fayette County Clerk Deed Book 304 Page 141*).<br>   
<br> 
What made Caroline Park unique and deeply meaningful to Dr. Perry Robinson and Mr. Emmett Reed?<br>

<br>
What makes this subdivision unique and deeply meaningful is that its streets hold the names reflecting the intention to build a community rooted in family and unity. The subdivision name, Caroline, was in reference to Dr. Perry D. Robinson’s late wife who had died in 1910\.  Of course, the street names Perry Ave and Robinson Terrace are the first and last names for Dr. Perry Robinson. Leslie Ave was named after one of Mr. Reed’s children. The street name Brown Ave comes from the maiden name of Emmett Reed’s late wife, Birdie Brown.   
But what really makes this particular area interesting is found in an April 2, 1925 Lexington Herald-Leader newspaper quote by Dr. Robinson, “*The facts are these: This property was purchased by E. H. Reed and myself from the heirs of Benjamin Tibbs, colored people who have owned it since 1825\.  Our purpose is to improve it into a modern subdivision for those of our group (negroes) who are desirous for neat and tidy building sites, with water, gas and paved streets and all other adjuncts for modern homes*.”<br>   
<br>
In other words, this particular area has been owned, occupied and preserved by the African American-Black community during the Antebellum period, prior to the Civil War, and up to the time when Dr. Robinson and Mr. Reed purchased the property from Benjamin Tibbs’s heirs.  But who is this Tibbs family?  And, is Dr. Robinson’s quote accurate and if so, what is the history behind this property and where is this property currently located at today?<br>   
<br>
Special thanks to the Digital Access Project of Kentucky, LLC (DAP) which is expanding access to Kentucky county’s historic documents that date back to early Kentucky history in the late 1700s, a researcher can find a wealth of interesting facts from the county records which then encourages a researcher to dig deeper into other repositories’ resources and materials to find answers and narrate stories. County land records are the oldest group of a completed set of records preserved. These records provide researches with a wealth of information including family names and other closely related connections, dates, locations, surveys, estate information, property ownership, consideration values, enslavers, enslaved people, marriage records, geographical and economic history, school census information, and county court orders.<br>   
<br>
This particular project research kicked off with Barbara Sutherland, the co-founder of (Segregated Lexington)[https://www.segregatedlexington.com/] and who serves on the Advisory Board for what is now known as (Black Yarn, Inc.)[https://blackyarn.com/] came across the articles pertaining to Dr. Robinson and this Caroline Park area. Ms. Sutherland wanted to learn more about the history of this area, in particular to the newspaper quote from Dr. Robinson, “*colored people who have owned it since 1825*.”  Ms. Sutherland presented several newspaper articles about Dr. Robinson, Mr. Reed, and the White community who opposed the development of Caroline Park to DAP Co-Director and Facility Supervisor, Mr. Shea Brown, who is also the Special Projects Deputy in the Land Records Department of the Fayette County Clerk’s Office, Lexington, KY. And, with Mr. Brown’s expertise and experience of 25 years, along with his colleague and DAP Co-Director and University of Kentucky Associate History Professor, Dr. Vanessa Holden, PhD., and their DAP Team Project Researcher and University of Kentucky History graduate, Leena Haider, the Team begin expanding access to the information found in regard to this particular area and property ownership.<br>   
<br>
One of the Lexington Herald-Leader newspaper articles dated July 10, 1921 had a Master Commissioner’s Sale of the property due to a Fayette Circuit Court order.  It details a description of the property, a chain of title, and parties to the suit filed. The parties to the suit of the Tibbs familyalso refers back even further to a Skinker family, in particular, to a man named John Skinker.  Absent from researching the names of the pioneers who owned this particular area, for the purpose of this story, we begin with John Skinker who purchased this property area which totaled around 13 – 15 acres (12 ¾ acres and 92 poles) in three separate deed transactions:<br>   
<br>  
**Deed \# 1** – From Asa and his wife Elizabeth Wilgus to John Skinker (6 ¼ acres and 30 poles) executed on February 27, 1809 in [Fayette County Clerk County Deed Book D Page 207](link to deed site)\.<br>   
<br>  

**Deed \# 2** – From John & his wife Hester Kiser to John Skinker (4 acres and 62 poles) executed on March 23, 1826 in [Fayette County Clerk Deed Book 1 Page 303](link to deed site)\.<br>   
<br>

**Deed \# 3** – From John and his wife Catherine Fisher to John Skinker (2 ½ acres) executed on August 20, 1828 in [Fayette County Clerk Deed Book 4 Page 22](link to deed site)\.<br>   
<br>         

But, what is significant about John Skinker?  Fayette County Clerk records documents that John Skinker was a “free man of color” who in Fayette County Court on May 12, 1828 emancipated his family, whom were not likely to become a county charge and no security was required, as followed:<br>   
<br>

1. Dorcia (\# 1\) – about 50 years old, aged woman, large, fleshly, 5’8’’, dark yellow complexion<br> 
2. Dorcia (\# 2), his daughter; and Dorcia’s (\# 1\) daughter too – about 19 years old, 5’6’’, yellow complexion<br> 
3. Susan, his daughter – about 16 years old, 5’0’’, light yellow complexion<br>   
4. Joseph, his son – about 21 years old, 5’9’’, well made, yellow complexion<br>  
5. Marshall, his son – about 23 years old, 5’10’’, yellow complexion<br>   
6. Nelly, his daughter & her 3 children – Nelly about 27 years old, 5’7’’, large, fleshly, yellow complexion<br>   
   1. John, her son – about 8 years old, 3’8’’, dark complexion<br>   
   2. Elizabeth, her daughter – about 5 years old, 3’0’’, dark yellow complexion<br>   
   3. Ben, her son – about 3 years old, 2’6’’, dark yellow complexion<br> 
<br>
As unusual as this may sound, oftentimes during the Institution of Slavery, free Black people of color, had to earn enough money to purchase their family as slaves in order to keep the family together with the intent, out of love and natural affection, to later emancipate them (*see [Fayette County Court Order Book 7 Page 78](https://fayettedeeds.com/nonIndexed/index.php) and [Fayette County Deed Book 4 Page 93(link to deed site)*).  This would have been the reason for John Skinker owning and emancipating his family.<br>
